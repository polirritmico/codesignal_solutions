"""
Consider a bishop, a knight and a rook on an n Ã— m chessboard. They are said to
form a triangle if each piece attacks exactly one other piece and is attacked by
exactly one piece. Calculate the number of ways to choose positions of the
pieces to form a triangle.

Note that the bishop attacks pieces sharing the common diagonal with it; the
rook attacks in horizontal and vertical directions; and, finally, the knight
attacks squares which are two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or
two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from its position.

Example

For n = 2 and m = 3, the output should be
solution(n, m) = 8.
